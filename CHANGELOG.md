- Snap to pixel when dragging curve edges
- Snap to pixel when dragging gradient stops
- Snap to pixel when changing rx/ry and size of primitive shapes

## 2.11.3 - 2025-14-08

### Added
- SVG Importer now supports `<clipPath>`, `<use>` and embedded base64 encoded `<image>` (results may vary)

### Changed
- Use Pascal case in stead of Camel case to represent imported svg file names
- Rename dock nodes in order to reference them with unique name

## 2.11.2 - 2025-10-08

### Added
- Shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+Mousewheel` to pick cutout shape
- Shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+Right click` to change clipping operation
- 'Rat's return' (examples/rats_return.tscn) to illustrate shape manipulation programmatically
- `Export as baked scene` button.
- Flag `use_union_in_stead_of_clipping` to `ScalableVectorShape2D` which turns a cutout into a merged shape
- Convenience method `clipped_polygon_has_point(global_pos : Vector2)` to detect clicks __on__ a shape without the click being in a hole
- A bubbly cloud example to illustrate `use_union_in_stead_of_clipping`

### Changed
- Separates out the calculation of outlines and fixes most issues with it (holes within holes not working yet)
- Can now cut holes in ellipses using right click in the add shapes programatically example.

## 2.11.0 - 2025-06-08

### Added
- Preparations for svg clipPath support by adding flag `use_intersect_when_clipping` to `ScalableVectorShape2D` which turns a cutout into a clip_path by invoking `Geometry2D.intersect_polygons(...)` in stead of `Geometry2D.clip_polygons(...)`

### Changed
- Bugfix: svg importer can now also use gradients defined _after_ the element referring to it via `href`

## 2.10.4 - 2025-04-08

### Added

- SVG importer evaluates all cutouts for a shape at once
- ScalableVectorShape2D caches outlines after tessellate and only reinvokes tessellate when the curve actually changes
- Only recalculate curve when local transform of cutout changes (cutout has to be direct child of parent for this to trigger correctly)
- Prevent global position form from being visible when plugin is enabled
- Bugfix: order of undo/redo operations fixed for dragging operations

## 2.10.2 - 2025-02-08

### Added
- You can now import an SVG file into any type of opened scene (3D, GUI, Node)
- You can now create a new ScalableVectorShape2D in any type of opened scene

### Changed
- Using uniqe names in stead of `find_node` to refer to tool controls

- Bugfix: svg transform attribute now supports multiple transform commands
- Bugfix: can now perform svg transform translate(...) with one parameter as well as two
- Bugfix: resets the cursor position of follow-up paths correcty now (after the z/Z command)
- Bugfix: SVG importer sets rx/ry values compliantly now

## 2.9.1 - 2025-27-07

### Added
- Use Ctrl+Shift+Left click to create a cutout shape for the selected shape

- Cutouts can be holes, made possible by multiple polygons
- Cutouts are `ScalableVectorShape2D` nodes themselves with all the same capabilities
- A `NavigationRegion2D` can now be assigned via the `navigation_region` property
- The SVG importer now also supports cutout paths within the `d="..."` attribute (results may vary)

## 2.8.2 - 2025-21-07

### Added
- The `collision_object` property is meant to replace the `collision_polygon` property
- This will hold an assignment to a descendant of `CollisionObject2D` (`Area2D`, `StaticBody2D`, etcetera)
- This managed `CollisionObject2D` will get directly generated `Polygon2D` children from the plugin

### Changed
- The `collision_polygon` property is now marked as deprecated (but will function the same for backward compatibility)
- Bugfix: fixed parsing bug for quadratic bÃ©zier curves

### Removed
- Removed the assignment inspector form field for the `collision_polygon` property once it has been unassigned

## 2.7.1 - 2025-16-07

### Added
- Add direct arc support for ScalableVectorShape2D: moving arcs around is now much easier by replacing many points by just the 2 (start and end)
- The arcs can be dynamically manipulated via metadata fields (radius, rotation, large arc, sweep -> see: [svg specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands))
- The arcs can also be animated using the `Curve Settings > Batch insert` button for key frames


### Changed
- Bugfix: fixed index out of bounds for scale-transform in svg importer.
- Removed `Rat` class_name from the rat example to prevent name conflicts.

## 2.6.6 - 2025-11-07

- ScalableVectorShape2D nodes can now only be selected when they are visible
- ScalableVectorShape2D nodes can not be selected anymore when they are locked using the lock-icon
- ScalableVectorShape2D nodes can not be selected anymore when they are part of a different scene

## 2.6.3 - 2025-06-15

### Added
